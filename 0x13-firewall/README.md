## 0x13-firewall
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
Uncomplicated Firewall is a program for managing a netfilter firewall designed to be easy to use. It uses a command-line interface consisting of a small number of simple commands, and uses iptables for configuration. UFW is available by default in all Ubuntu installations.
